# Recognize-digits-in-images-with-machine-learning-and-deep-neural-network
In this repo, I tried to write different model to recoginize hand-written digits from images. I used three different methods:
- Traditional machine learning has 97% accuracy
- Deep Neural Network has 98% accuracy
- Convolutional neural network has 99% accuracy

The deep neural network and convolutional neural network use Pytorch framework.
